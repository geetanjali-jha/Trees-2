/**
 * Approach: 
 * This problem is about calculating the total sum of all numbers formed by root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree.
 * I used a depth-first search (DFS) recursive approach, where at each node we build the current number by shifting the 
 * digits (multiplying by 10) and adding the current nodeâ€™s value. When a leaf node is reached, the formed number is added
 * to the total sum; the recursion continues for all paths until the final total is returned.
